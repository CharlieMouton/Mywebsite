        <h3> Engineering is Problem Solving </h3>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I came to college thinking I would graduate an engineer, but instead will be graduating as a user-oriented interaction designer with a non-traditional engineering education. After being exposed to the user-oriented design process during the summer after my first year, I realized that this passion for tackling challenges was going to be best utilized as a designer, where I can think critically about the experience of the user and create experiences that are tailored to the user’s needs.


        <h3> Not First World Problems, real World Problems </h3>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As I continue to develop as a designer, I want to ensure that my knowledge and efforts are working towards a better world. I stumbled upon <a style="a:hover{text-decoration: underline;}" href="https://medium.com/startup-grind/im-done-pretending-sf-tech-is-visionary-9d0e91bfacfb#.y3q5w1qcc"> this medium article by Marco Marandiz</a> which discusses Silicon Valley’s vast level of expertise which is wasted on creating apps what solve first world problems. I don’t want to solve first world problems; I want to solve real World Problems. I want to reduce human suffering and inefficiency by creating interactions that are free of confusion and enjoyable to use.


        <h3> Designing for Users and Non-Users Alike </h3>

  	    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Even though most of my work is supported by discovered needs of users, it is also important to consider the non-users. It is the job of creators to ensure that the products we create are not just beneficial for our users, but for humanity. I aim to not lose sight of the bigger picture as I jump from project to project, and wrestle with ecological and moral considerations as I work.
