        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Early in college, I was given the opportunity to spend a summer working with one other student to completely redesign the classroom of a popular course called Principles of Engineering. We created a unique design process based off of processes discussed in the d.School's <i>Make Space</i> and the process taught in Olin's course, User-Oriented Collaborative Design. This was my first time working through a design process of any kind, and I quickly realized that it is possible to engineer for people with people. We conducted user interviews early in the summer, and performs codesigns and design reviews with those stakeholders that ultimately engaged with our finished product.

        <img class="lrgImg" src="assets/img/POE/sketches.jpg" alt="Lots of annotated sketches are shown pinned to the wall. These posters allowed us to better understand each other's ideas and get inspired based off of ideas already discussed."> </img>

        <img class="lrgImg" src="assets/img/POE/cb_Prototype2.jpg" alt="We prototyped several full-scale cardboard ideas inluding team carts which are stored in stalls located at the back of the room."> </img>

        <img class="lrgImg" src="assets/img/POE/annotations.jpg" alt="After building each cardboard prototype, we would print and annotate images of the idea, adding perks and potential drawbacks to each design. This critical analysis helped us narrow down and ultimately decide of the ideas to move forward with."> </img>

        <img class="smlImgLeft" src="assets/img/POE/layouts_w_Magnets.jpg" alt="We printed a large floor plan of the room and created magnet representations of the different furniture in the space. We were then able to explore different configurations of the room, looking to maximize work space."> </img>

        <img class="smlImgRight" src="assets/img/POE/osb_Prototype.jpg" alt="To test our final prototypes, we generated a prototype out of cheap OSB wood. We were then able to show the prototype to users and get confirmation that the table's size would be appropriate for users."> </img>
